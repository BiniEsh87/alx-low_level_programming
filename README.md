# Low-level programming & Algorithm

Module of **Low-level programming** and **algorithm**, carried out during **ALX Software Engineering programme** at **ALX + HOLBERTON**.   [ALX-AFRICA](https://www.alxafrica.com/software/)


## Technologies
* Scripts written in Bash 5.0.17
* C files are compiled using `gcc version 9.3.0`
